=== Symbols vs Variables ===

A symbol only matches against itself in a rule.
A variable matches against any sub-expression in a rule.

Standard symbols are recognized automatically.
Custom symbols must start with two lowercase alphabetic letters.

Examples:

  x     variable
  x0    variable
  X     variable
  xF    variable
  Foo   variable
  sin   standard symbol
  foo   custom symbol
