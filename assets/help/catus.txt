=== Catuṣkoṭi Existential Lift ===

Catuṣkoṭi is 4-value logic that was developed in traditional Indian logic.

                    lifted existential path
  - true        =>  idb
  - false       =>  not
  - both        =>  true
  - neither     =>  false

A "truth value" in Catuṣkoṭi is 1 of these four statements.
Each truth value maps to an existential path of type `bool -> bool`.

Catuṣkoṭi Existential Lift means that equations of the form:

  f(x) = <Catuṣkoṭi truth>

Is lifted to the following form:

  ∃(f{(= x)}) = <Catuṣkoṭi truth lifted to existential path>

Since existential paths might be hard to wrap your head around,
one can use Catuṣkoṭi existential lift to simplify theorem proving
when reasoning about indeterminacy.

Indeterminacy happens under non-determinism,
but also over normal paths that depends on the input, e.g.:

  collatz[even](true) = both

It means that the normal path `collatz[even]` is not inhabited by
the type `type -> type`. However, the existential path is still meaningful!
