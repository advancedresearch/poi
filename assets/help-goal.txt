=== Goal Oriented Theorem Proving ===

A goal is an expression you would like to find.

For example, to prove that `1 + 1 = 2`, type `goal 2` and then `1+1`.
You can also type `goal 1+1` and then `2`.

When the goal is not found by reduction,
it is searched for among equivalent expressions up to some depth.
You can control the depth using `reset depth` and `inc depth`.

For example:

goal x+y+z
z+y+x

The equivalence `depth: 2 <=>  (x + (z + y))` shows that the goal is found.
It takes 3 more steps to complete the proof, where `depth: 0` is the last step.

- `min depth` sets automated minimum depth toward goal
- `pick depth` sets user chooses equivalence toward goal

Use `reset goal` to go back to default mode of theorem proving.
