=== Normal Paths ===

A normal path is the secret sauce of path semantics. There are two kinds:

  - symmetric paths e.g. `f[g]`
  - asymmetric paths e.g. `f[g0 x g1 -> g2]`

A normal path is basically everything one can predict about a function.

The properties `g0` and `g1` of the input of `f` predicts the property `g2`:

  f[g0 x g1 -> g2]

In equational form:

   g2(f(a, b)) = h(g0(a), g1(a))
