=== Poi Reduce Help ===
Made by Sven Nilsen, 2020

Poi is based on the theory of path semantics:
https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics

Special commands:
- bye            quits the program
- inline all     inlines all definitions from previous expression
- ``             prints separator for readability
- echo <expr>    prints out debug format of expression
- def <symbol>   lists definitions of symbol
- std            lists all rules in standard library
- help norm      more help about normal paths
- help sym       more help about symmetric paths
- help asym      more help about asymmetric paths
- help eqv       more help about equivalent expressions
- help dom       more help about domains and partial functions
- help triv      more help about trivial paths
- help ex        more help about existential paths
- help rad       more help about radians (trigonometry)

Type in an expression in path semantics, e.g. `and[not]`
