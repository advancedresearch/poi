Poi is based on the theory of path semantics:
https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics

Special commands:
- bye            quits the program
- inline all     inlines all definitions from previous expression
- help asym      more help about asymmetric paths
- help eqv       more help about equivalent expressions
- help dom       more help about domains and partial functions

Type in an expression in path semantics, e.g. `and[not]`
